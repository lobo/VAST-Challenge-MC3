In the first six images we can see the interactions of the group over the six semesters, each interaction is displayed in a different color. The suspected bad actors are in orange, the other employees are in blue. 

As in the previous question, the blue nodes are employees that are closely associated with this group, meaning to have more than one interaction with a member of the orange nodes group.

The fifth image shows the amount of interactions the suspected bad actors had with anyone else in the company. The sixth image shows the amount of interactions they had within their group. In both of them, the bigger the area of each person, the bigger the amount of interactions (of any kind) they had.

Some members as Richard Fox or Lindsy Henion have a great participation along the eight images displayed in this answer.
